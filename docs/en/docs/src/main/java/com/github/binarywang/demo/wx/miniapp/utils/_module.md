| Brief Description | The JsonUtils utility class uses ObjectMapper to convert objects to JSON strings, automatically ignoring null values and formatting the output, returning null in case of exceptions. |

# Description

JsonUtils is a utility class designed for JSON serialization. It employs ObjectMapper as its core component and configures two key options in the static initialization block: ignoring null fields and enabling indented formatting for output. The class provides a static method `toJson` that converts any object into a JSON string. If a JsonProcessingException occurs during the conversion, the exception stack trace will be printed and null will be returned. The entire class is designed concisely, focusing solely on JSON serialization functionality.
