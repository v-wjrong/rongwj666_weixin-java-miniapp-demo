| Brief Description | The JsonUtils utility class uses ObjectMapper to convert objects into JSON strings, automatically ignoring null values and formatting the output, returning null in case of exceptions. |

# Description

JsonUtils is a utility class designed for handling JSON serialization. It employs ObjectMapper as its core component and configures two key options in the static initialization block: ignoring null fields and enabling indented formatting for output. The class provides a static method, toJson, which converts any object into a JSON string. If a JsonProcessingException occurs during the conversion process, the exception stack trace is printed, and null is returned. The entire class is designed concisely, focusing solely on JSON serialization functionality.
