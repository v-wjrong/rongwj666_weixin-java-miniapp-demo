| Brief Description | The core backend module of the WeChat Mini Program includes media management, user sessions, and WeChat interaction functionalities, relying on the WeChat SDK and Lombok. It supports file uploads, identity authentication, and message routing, with processes covering validation, processing, and cleanup. The error handling module uniformly manages 404/500 responses. The configuration module manages Mini Program properties and initializes message services. The Spring Boot application entry class launches the entire demo. |

# Description

## Overview  
This module is an integrated solution for WeChat Mini Program backend services, with core responsibilities including media file management, user session management, interaction with WeChat servers, and unified error handling. The interface specification requires validating AppID effectiveness, adhering to Spring MVC standards, and injecting configurations via the `wx.miniapp` prefix. Key data structures encompass media_id, user session objects, WeChat message encapsulation, and the WxMaProperties.Config configuration class. External dependencies include the WeChat SDK, Spring Framework, and Lombok utility library. For example, the media controller handles multi-file uploads, the error controller returns unified views, and the configuration class enables multi-account management.  

## Primary Business Scenarios  
The module supports four types of typical interactions: media file transfer (similar to cloud storage interfaces), user authentication (similar to OAuth 2.0), WeChat message routing (similar to an event bus pattern), and HTTP error handling (similar to web server error pages). The complete business process consists of three stages: credential verification → business processing → resource cleanup. For instance, user login verifies the code or redirects to an error page in case of exceptions. Integration examples cover file uploads, session decryption, message responses, and error prompts, such as POST interfaces processing encrypted messages or GET returning 404 views. All interactions are implemented through standard Spring MVC controllers.

This flowchart illustrates the core structure of the WeChat Mini Program Demo project, starting from the root directory `binarywang` and hierarchically expanding to the `miniapp` module, which includes submodules such as `controller`, `utils`, `error`, `config`, and their corresponding Java class files. The `controller` module contains three controller classes, `utils` and `error` each have two utility and error-handling classes, the `config` module has two configuration classes, and the top level also includes the main application class `WxMaDemoApplication.java`.
