| Brief Description | WeChat Mini Program backend core modules, including media management, user sessions, and WeChat interaction features, utilizing ThreadLocal to ensure thread safety. The configuration center manages multiple accounts and message routing, while the error handling module uniformly processes status codes like 404/500. It relies on the WeChat SDK and Spring framework, supporting a stateless design for high concurrency. |

# Description

## Overview  
This module is a collection of backend services for WeChat Mini Programs, comprising core controllers, configuration centers, and error handling systems. Its core responsibilities include media file management, user session maintenance, interaction with WeChat servers, and unified error routing, employing ThreadLocal to ensure thread safety in a pattern similar to an event bus. The unified interface specification covers POST/PGET request handling, AppID validation, JSON responses, and Spring MVC error routing. Key data structures include MediaID lists, user session information (SessionKey/OpenID), WeChat message bodies, and ErrorPage mappings. It relies on the WeChat JSSDK, AES encryption libraries, and the Spring Web framework, such as invoking WeChat APIs via JNI or dynamically loading multi-account configurations.  

## Key Business Scenarios  
The typical application pattern involves: users obtaining SessionKey after login to decrypt data, media files being transferred via MediaID, and error requests automatically routed to preset pages. Business processes follow a "validate-process-cleanup" pattern, such as validating AppID before calling WeChat APIs for file uploads and finally clearing thread configurations. Full functionality covers OAuth2.0 authorization, AES-ECB decryption, batch multi-file uploads, and message routing (e.g., QR code processing). The interaction design resembles RESTful style, including server-side rendering interfaces (error pages) and customer service message responses, ensuring thread safety and state management under high concurrency.

This flowchart illustrates the directory structure of a WeChat Mini Program Java project, starting from the root package `com` and expanding level by level until reaching the main module `miniapp`. The `miniapp` module contains four submodules: `controller` (controllers), `utils` (utility classes), `error` (error handling), and `config` (configuration), along with the main application file. Each submodule includes corresponding functional class files, forming a clear hierarchical relationship.
